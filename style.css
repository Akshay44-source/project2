Core Workflow

git init – Start a new repository.

git clone <url> – Copy a remote repository.

git status – Check what’s changed.

git add <file> – Stage changes (mark them for commit).

git commit -m "msg" – Save staged changes.

git commit --amend – Edit the last commit (message or changes).

git push – Send commits to remote.

git pull – Fetch + merge latest changes from remote

Branching

git branch – List branches.

git branch <name> – Create a new branch.

git checkout <name> – Switch branches.

git checkout -b <name> – Create and switch to a branch.

git merge <branch> – Merge another branch into current.

git pull --rebase – Safer pull (avoids messy merges if you forgot to pull before pushing).

Inspecting

git log – Show commit history.

git diff – Show unstaged changes.

git diff --staged – Show staged (to-be-committed) changes.

git diff HEAD – Show changes since last commit.

Undo & Fix

git reset <file> – Unstage a file.

git reset --hard <commit> – Roll back to commit (destructive).

git revert <commit> – Undo by making a new commit (safe).
